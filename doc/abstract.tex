The OpenTuner framework provides domain-agnostic tools for the implementation
of autotuners. It sequentially evaluates program configurations exploring
search spaces that are commonly very large. This paper proposes a new
methodology and a protocol for the distributed execution of autotuners. Both
contributions are implemented in the OpenTuner framework as an extension to the
OpenTuner measurement driver by distributing and parallelizing the measurement
process via cloud computing resources. The performance evaluation shows that
autotuners implemented with the extension are able to achieve good performance
using few and cheap cloud computing resources, lowering the cost and the power
consumption of producing an autotuned solution.

result normalization research question.}
