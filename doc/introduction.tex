\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

The program autotuning problem fits in the framework of the Algorithm Selection
Problem, introduced by Rice in 1976~\cite{rice1976algorithm}. The objective of
an autotuner is to select the best algorithm, or algorithm configuration, for
each instance of a problem.  Algorithms or configurations are selected
according to performance metrics such as the time to solve the problem
instance, the accuracy of the solution and the energy consumed.  The set of all
possible algorithms and configurations that solve a problem defines a
\emph{search space}. Various optimization techniques search this space, guided
by the performance metrics, for the algorithm or configuration that best solve
the problem.

Autotuners can specialize in domains such as matrix
multiplication~\cite{bilmes1997phipac}, dense~\cite{whaley1998atlas} or
sparse~\cite{vuduc2005oski} matrix linear algebra, and parallel
programming~\cite{jordan2012multi}. Other autotuning frameworks provide more
general tools for the representation and search of program configurations,
enabling the implementation of autotuners for different problem
domains~\cite{ansel2014opentuner,hutter2009paramils}.

The OpenTuner framework~\cite{ansel2014opentuner} provides tools for the
implementation of autotuners for various problem domains. It implements
different search techniques that explore the same search space for program
optimizations. Although support for parallel compilation is provided in the
framework the empirical exploration of the search space, that is, running and
measuring program execution time, is done sequentially.

The contributions of this paper are a new methodology and a protocol for the
distributed execution of autotuners using cloud computing resources.  The
methodology and protocol are implemented as extensions to the OpenTuner
framework distributing and parallelizing the exploration of optimization spaces
by combining results obtained from virtual machines running in a network.  A
local machine (LM) runs the main OpenTuner application and several virtual
machines (VM) run measurement modules that provide results when requested,
performing a more efficient exploration of the search space.

The interactions between the local and virtual machines follows the
client-server model. The local machine runs a measurement client that requests
results from various measurement servers running in virtual machines hosted at
the Google Compute Engine (GCE).  We compare the performance of our extension
with the unmodified framework in a benchmark of applications,
identifying the problem domains that benefit from this cloud-based approach.
