\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented an extension of the OpenTuner autotuning framework
enabling it to leverage the cloud computing resources from GCE.  We propose
four approaches to solve the result normalization problem which would enable
transposing the results obtained in virtual machines to a local machine.
