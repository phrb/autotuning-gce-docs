\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented a methodology and an application protocol for distributing
autotuning measurements using cloud computing. We also presented an
implementation of the methodology and protocol, as an extension of the
OpenTuner autotuning framework.  We evaluated the performance and costs of our
methodology and protocol using instances of the Travelling Salesperson Problem
and the Google Compute Engine.
Our results show that the methodology reduces the financial cost of finding a solution
for the TSP.
We also proposed four approaches to solve the result normalization problem which
would enable transposing the results obtained in VMs to a LM.

To the best of our knowledge, the methodology and protocol presented in this
paper are the first to propose using cloud computing resources to
reduce the
autotuning financial costs using the OpenTuner framework.
