\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

This paper presented a methodology and an application protocol for distributing
autotuning measurements using cloud computing. We also present an
implementation of the methodology and protocol, as an extension of the
OpenTuner autotuning framework.  We evaluate the performance and costs of our
methodology and protocol using instances of the Travelling Salesperson Problem
and the Google Compute Engine.
Our results show that the methodology lowers the costs of finding a solution
for the TSP.
We propose four approaches to solve the result normalization problem which
would enable transposing the results obtained in virtual machines to a local
machine.

Future work will analyse the performance of our methodology and protocol in
different problem domains, determining the ones that benefit the most from
this approach. We will also study the normalization techniques we proposed.

To the best of our knowledge, the methodology and protocol presented in this
paper are the first to propose using cloud computing resources to lower the
autotuning costs using the OpenTuner framework.
