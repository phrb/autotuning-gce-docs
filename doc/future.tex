\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Future work will analyze the performance of our methodology and protocol in
different problem domains, determining the ones that benefit the most from this
approach. To effectively leverage cloud computing for autotuning it will be
necessary to better understand how VM initialization,
communication and tuning times impact performance. We would like to run more
extensive experiments and use different public clouds.

We will also study normalization techniques, composing benchmarks of problems
that expose architecture-dependant features to the autotuner and analyzing the
performance of our proposed techniques in those problems.
