\section{OpenTuner} \label{sec:ot}

OpenTuner search spaces are defined by \emph{Configuration}s, that are composed
of \emph{Parameter}s of various types. Each type has restricted bounds and
manipulation functions that enable the exploration of the search space.
OpenTuner implements ensembles of optimization techniques that
perform well in different problem domains. The framework uses
\emph{meta-techniques} to coordinate the distribution of resources
between techniques.
Results found during search are shared through a
database. An OpenTuner application can implement its own search
techniques and meta-techniques, making the ensemble more robust.

Figure~\ref{fig:ot-imp} shows a high-level view of OpenTuner's architecture.
Measurement and searching are done in separate modules, whose main classes are
called \emph{drivers}. The search driver requests measurements by registering
configurations to the database. The measurement driver reads those
configurations and writes back the desired results.  Currently, the
measurements are performed sequentially.

OpenTuner implements optimization techniques such as the
Nelder-Mead~\cite{nelder1965simplex} simplex method and Simulated
Annealing~\cite{kirkpatrick1983optimization}. A resource sharing mechanism,
called \emph{meta-technique}, aims to take advantage of the strengths of each
technique by balancing the exploitation of a technique that has produced good
results in the past and the exploration of unused and possibly better ones.
